# Sonnet-Of-The-Damned-Band-Site

### Milestone project 1: A static webpage for the melodic hardcore band Sonnet Of The Damned. 

The goal of this is to create a usable website for the britisih melodic hardcore band Sonnet of the Damned.
The project is intended to provide a website that is helpful for both fans of the band in acquiring merchandise and
information and providing potential fans of the band the ability to grow their love for them.


## UX/UI

The website is for fans of the band and potential fans and is made to serve two seperate purposes. 

1. The first purpose is to help fans of the band with acquiring information on the band that helps the band grow, such as
finding out when they are performing and where and potentially providing the ability to purchase tickets for these shows,
purchasing merchandise and just finding out news about new releases and information about the band as often fans are
willing to spend more money if they feel a personal connection to the performers, so providing information on the bands 
origins and their individual members helps to do this. 

2. The second purpose is to help grow the bands audience by giving potential fans of the band the information they need to
learn more about the band and links to the bands music. Although these links aren't necessary for people who are already
fans, they are critical for newcomers so that they can hear the bands music as easily as possible, potentially become
fans and join the first group spoken about above, allowing the band to become more financially successful. This is why the
merchandise and tour pages require use of the navbar where as the newest release, news and about the band section are able
to be accessed directly from the homepage, optimising the site to provide those who are likely to spend the least time 
looking around with the information we want to convey to them first. 

### HOMEPAGE UX/UI

* The homepage provides short descriptions of news, new releases and about the band so that it encourages the user to click
further and explore more, as if we gave them everything on the homepage they'd have no reason to go any further. This is
why each section has been put onto its own seperate page, as although the website could be achieved by having a single
long homepage with an individual section instead for each piece, it wouldn't encourage the same exploration or allow
people who already know what they want to get there as easily. It doesn't include tour or merchandise to provide a much
more succinct homepage and as this is something only really necessary for those who are already fans, people who won't be
dissuaded by two extra clicks of the hamburger icon and the page name.

* The wireframe for the homepage is linked below (The navbar would be minimised by default and is shown as such on all other
wireframes but has been displayed open on this first wireframe to provide the general idea of its design and how it would
appear on all pages when opened)

### NEWS UX/UI

* The news page provides a purpose to user for finding out about what the band are up to, as fans of artists often want to
know this kind of information and get as involved as possible in the artist. This allows them to find out what the band 
are up to professionally, such as new releases and information that is provided by the artist for marketing reasons (such 
as performing for a charity, etc.) The news page is designed with three sections inside of it so that its easy to keep 
things relevant and current even if there isn't that much new stuff to talk about. These news boxes will have to be filled
with their information manually, although in an ideal world with enough time I would have them organised with the newest 
piece of news on the left and likely use a javascript library to make them automatically shift to the right by one each 
time a new one is added.

### TOUR UX/UI

* The tour page is designed with two large boxes each containing the dates and locations of performances, each date having a
single line for it with large margins above and below it. It has been structured this way to make it as easy as possible
to find the tour date and location that is most useful for the user, as the tour page unavoidably needs to hold a lot of
information for a band that plays often and in many locations. I feel the two boxes let the information be seperated in an
efficient way while not requiring the user to scroll down for a long time to find what they are looking for. The faster we
can get a nearby tour date infront of someone's eyes, the better, but if we use too many boxes or too small text the shows
will get lost amongst each other and be useless to anyone other than the most determined user.

### MERCH UX/UI

* The merch section is designed with rows of boxes, each three long and initially having two rows, each box containing a
picture of the product and the name of the product below it. The reason it's been done this way is to allow for future 
expandability, so that if more products were to be added another row could be created below it very easily without
changing the general shape and design of the page and so that a large amount of products can be seen off of a single
glance. Each box will be clickable to link to the product placed within it, although for a band of the size of Sonnet it
doesn't make sense to create individual pages for each product as they are unlikely to be able to meet the demands of 
processing payment, shipping, etc themselves. For this reason these would likely be external links to print-to-order 
companies that work with dropshipping companies, social media influencers and of course, musicians. The text section is 
very small as very little information needs to be provided at first glance beside the name and possibly price of the 
product being advertised. The picture is the truly important point and thus takes up the majority of the space. All other
necessary information such as sizing for clothing, descriptions, fabric types, etc. can be provided on the other side of
the external link.

#### ABOUT UX/UI

* The about page is created with two sections.

1. The first provides information about the origins of the band, what they do,
what they aspire to be, who they take inspiration from, etc. This is inside a large box that takes up about 80% of the
screen, and is further split into thirds within that 80%, with the first two thirds being columns of text providing the
information mentioned before and the last third being another picture of the band. It's created this way to keep the 
design interesting and not overload the user with too much text, as if things are boring the user will leave quicker than
we want them to.

1. The second section takes that same 80% of the screen, but instead does it with 4 equal boxes in a single row. This creates
more boxes in one row than any other page on the website, but is a purposeful decision. Each box provides a picture of and
information on an individual band member, and these smaller boxes make sense as we probably want to provide much less 
detailed info when talking about each musician seperate from the band as a whole. This second section is designed really
for either those looking for information about the band members (questions like 'What's the bassist from Sonnet's name 
again?" are solved by this) or for those that were really, genuinely intrigued by the information in the first section and
want to know more.

### HEADER UX/UI

* The header was designed with a simple goal and thus is kept very basic. The links to the current active socials are
provided on the left, the name of the band is centered and the burger icon to access the navbar is to the right. It was
done this way so that the social media's are extremely easy to find, the name of the band is obvious and apparent and the
navbar is minimised by default but easy to get to when needed. It also makes it very easy to adapt in the future, such as
if the band joined a new social media platform they would only need to add one more icon to the left to update the site
without changing the overall appearance. 

### NAVBAR UX/UI

* The navbar was designed as simply as possible with just the names of the pages they are linking provided ina large highly
readable font, and all of these being centered towards the middle with good margins to the left and right to make them as
obvious as possible. This simple design, much like the header, is made to be future proof, as adding a new page to the
site would be as simple as dropping another link in and assigning it the same classes as provided to the rest.

### FOOTER UX/UI

* The footer was designed with a similar but slightly different thought process from the navbar and header. To provide info
that needs to be provided without drawing attention in the same way the rest of the site is supposed to. Stuff like copy-
rights and legal information that you want findable but aren't fighting to get seen. I've also included smaller buttons
that link to the same social medias as the buttons found in the header to the right, so that if a standard user who 
couldn't care less about the legals does find their eyes down around the footer, they can still gain valuable information
from it. 

### GENERAL AND MOBILE UX/UI

* The last bit of UX and UI I wish to talk about is the general shape of the site. It's very obvious from the way I've designed it
that I like making use of squares, rectangles and generally splitting things and information into their own individual 
pieces. The reason its been done this way is dual faceted. The first is that it allows to cleanly seperate information away
from things that don't relate to it and lets a user focus in completely on the bit they care about without having to work to
filter out what they don't. The second is that the site was also designed with mobile devices in mind, and this design of 
pieces, all split into halfs, thirds and quarters allows the site to adapt to mobile with a much smaller amount of media
queries needing to be used to adapt things. The columns of text in the about section for example, would change from thirds
to a string of text and a picture below it, and the rectangles for each band member will simply fall below each other one
by one.


## IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

### NAVBAR ICON 

* I included a navbar icon to allow it to be expanded and minimised as a feature for a few reasons. It wasn't really necessary
but it does save space on the initial view of the homepage and thus allows more of the important information thats really 
trying to drag people in to be viewed without delay. 

### SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS

* In the header and footer I included icons that link to the various relevant social medias simply because to alot of artists
their social medias are far more important to them than their individual websites, and are thus updated more often than a 
website will be. The same applies to the use by a user, as the average person is likely to check their facebook far more 
than they are to visit the website of a specific band, so having these links provided in an easy to notice, immediately
apparent form is more helpful for the user and the band. 


## CONSIDERED FEATURES

### CONTACT FORM 

* I looked at implenting a contact form, and this would have been fairly easy to do, but decided not to go for it as although
it sounds like something that would be valuable, it wouldn't have actually had a large practical use to the band. When the
purpose of the website is to help sell to your fans and bring in new fans to sell to, a contact form doesn't aid either of
these goals, and although it might have been helpful for the band to allow promoters and venues to contact them for booking,
it was unlikely to be used much anyway as most promoters contact small bands directly through their social medias or by 
emailing them (I take this information from the last 5 years I've spent running my own small independent promotion company).
Because of this, I felt it was better to just include the bands contact email in the footer and allow the social buttons to
do the job otherwise. This achieves the same goal but is quicker and more space efficient.

### PAYMENT SYSTEM

* I looked at implementing a payment system through the use of a javascript library so that merchandise and show tickets could
be sold directly on the website, and although this would have been good to include and potentially increase turnover for the
band, I decided that at my current skill level it would take too long to do to create something I was happy with. Not to
mention, its still very easy to include the ability to sell merch and tickets, by simply swapping a built in payment system 
out for external companies. Merchandise can be delivered through print-to-order companies like printful.com and the tickets
for the shows can be done through websites like ticketsource.co.uk. These external companies might take commissions from the
band that a built in payment system wouldn't, but are far more realistic and manageable for a small band. 


## LIBRARIES 

### BOOTSTRAP

* The project makes use of bootstrap throughout the site quite simply because it makes alot of things a whole lot easier. from
shaping the site into the halfs, thirds and quarters I spoke about before to adaptation for mobile devices and different
screen sizes, bootstraps pre-included classes helped massively with the construction of the site.

## DIFFICULTIES AND BUGS 

### BUILDING THE NAVBAR

The first difficulty started right from minute 1, as I began my project with building the navbar, intending to handle all of
the features that applied to all the pages first (header, footer, navbar). Straight away I struggled as my navbar button
wasn't doing anything when I clicked on it. After looking through Bootstrap documentation I realised I'd imported the main 
bootstrap library but not the JQuery and JS sections, so it made sense it wasn't responding. After that I was having two
issues.

[Bootstrap Documentation On Importing The Library](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)


* The first being that I needed my collapsible navbar to appear horizontal/inline on tablets and desktops and vertical 
on mobile and couldn't work it out. The problem was I was looking through bootstrap documentation for something like this
but only finding information on navbars that weren't collapsible at all on desktops. I eventually decided I was wasting my 
own time trying to solve this through classes and just used a media query to do it. 

* The second was that I needed to center the list elements in the navbar and the band name. By inspecting the page I realised
the margin aligning the band name/link to the left was the problem and by setting it to margin:auto in css was able to fix 
this right away, but the same didn't apply for my unordered list and its child elements. I then tried to use mx-auto (boot-
strap's built in centering class) as well as text-align: center in css, and still had no luck. I looked through various stack-
overflow pages on google for help with my problem but couldn't figure it out, but then noticed that the list elements were
centering in mobile view but not desktop or tablet. I used this information to look through the media query I had created, 
realising that something that was different between them would give me my answer. From there I realised that while attempting
to make my list items appear inline for desktop view I had assigned the unordered list to float: left, but in the media 
query had assigned it the value of float: none. I changed the float to none in the desktop view and it immediately worked with
my text-align: center; from there, showing me that the float: left was essentially blocking all my attempts to center the list 
and that its likely that any of the things I tried to center it would have worked.

### ADJUSTING THE NAVBAR FOR MOBILE

I had gotten the navbar how I wanted it on desktop, but the issue was that when viewed on mobile, the social media icons I had
implemented were stacking above the band logo, causing a disjointed and very odd look that didn't fit at all with the wireframes
I'd designed for mobile. I spent some time researching this on the internet but wasn't really getting anywhere, as although I
knew this problem could be fixed by moving the social media icons below the band logo in the HTML, it would break the desktop
layout I had worked very hard to achieve. In the end I contacted code institute tech-support for this, where I was given a
brilliant piece of advice. Duplicate the code, having a copy of the social media icons below and above the band logo in the 
HTML, assign both UL's containing the icons their own individual ID and then using the media queries I had already created,
give the mobile UL a value of display: none; and the desktop UL a value of display: block;, then simply copy that into my
media query for mobile devices and reverse the two. A perfect solution and one I'm likely to use again throughout this project.

### CHANGING THE NAVBAR ICON COLOR

I wanted to change the color of the toggler icon but was struggling to figure out how to do so, as simply assigning values like
border-color: white; weren't changing anything. Bootstrap by default comes with two classes for this, navbar-dark and navbar-
light, but they provide an offwhite and grey color that both didn't really fufill my needs. I looked it up online and was 
eventually able to find a solution by borrowing code from [this](https://www.codeply.com/go/4FdZGlPMNV/bootstrap-4-custom-navbar-toggler-icon-color) website, which explained that 
bootstrap provides the color of the icon through the use of an SVG background image, and so it was recommended to use the 
link they provided and then simply change the RGB values and stroke size to fit your needs, after that you can just define the
border-width and border-color as normal. 


### CREATING THE FOOTER

When creating the footer, I looked through my previous mini projects for inspiration but decided I wanted to keep things simple,
as my design for them was so simple I didn't need anything special, just a p on the left and an almost exact copy of my social
links on the right, but simply giving them their own independent id to allow me to downscale them. I looked at a couple of
methods for this and decided because they were so far apart and unlikely to overlap I could just give them absolute positioning
and affix them to the left and right respectively. This was perfect for desktop and tablet but did cause overlap on mobile, which
I just solved with a media query that set the social links to display: none on mobile screens. This did alter from my wireframe
design but I realised it was for the best anyway as to make them the right size relative to the navbar social links I'd have to 
make them so small they would be effectively useless anyway, so it was better off to not have them and just keep the footer for
the legal info that I believe is important to appear on every device.

### CENTERING ELEMENTS 

I had quite a few problems at first with getting my objects and elements to center within their various containers or simply on
the page. Text I had no problem with, as the text-center class was taking care of it for the jumbotrons and most things, but 
when it came to images, iframes and a few other things I just couldn't get it to cooperate. I looked for advice on stack overflow
and was told that simply using margin: 0 auto; in the css for the element would do as I needed, but this never seemed to be the case.
After some testing I realised that margin: 0 auto; was working when I applied it to a div, but not when I applied it directly to an
img or a class within it, so I made use of this info and anything that wasn't cooperating I simply wrapped in a div entirely for this
purpose and then used margin: 0 auto; on that div.


## TESTING

### LINKS 

To test my site once it was done, I first went through it and clicked on every single external link on every page to make sure that
I had no issues with this and that they all worked well. There was no problem here.

Next I went ahead and re-did that test but using the inspect element and running it in a mobile setting, and then the same on tablet,
both again worked completely.

I did notice though that on all the links provided on the merch.html page (outside the social links as that code is the same on every
page) I had not included the target="_blank" section, and so they weren't opening in a new tab. I went through the page immediately 
after and added those, then re-tested the links and saw they all open in a new tab as intended now, so that's no longer an issue. 

### TESTING WITHOUT CSS 

I decided for my next test I would run the site without the style.css file, to see how it presents itself. Although of course it comes
up very baron, the thought process was it should still technically work. It was from here that I realised that on plenty of img elements
I had forgotten to include an alt, reducing the usability of the site massively for visually impaired users. I went back through my .html
files, used ctrl+f to find every img and made sure an alt was added for every single one. I then re-tested and this helped fill the 
css-less version of the site much better. 

### TESTING VARIOUS SCREEN SIZES 

I next went through my site entirely using multiple mobile and tablet based views in chrome's developer tools, as well as using firefox 
as well to get a second browsers perspective. I was happy with the result that I got, as I had made sure to ensure each paged looked good
on all three screen sizes before moving onto the next .html document. 

The only real issue is that certain pages don't appear very well on larger tablet sizes. They are centered and even, but often the elements
appear just a bit smaller than they need to be. The reasoning for this is that as I built my project I made sure to adapt it for tablet by
using the Ipad resolution view in chrome developer tools, and made sure I was happy with that view along with desktop and mobile. It wasn't 
until I was testing the project that I decided to click and see what it would look like on Ipad Pro's resolution. The answer was, not terrible,
but just not optimum. The reason for this is that in my media queries I had adjusted things for different screens using pixels, and although 
this looked fine on my ipad, iphone x, pixel 2 and galaxy s5 view, I'd never even considered how that would adapt to vastly different
non-desktop screens.

I decided to see how the best way to adapt this would be and went back and applied it to my about page. I've definitely learnt from doing so
that if I was to do this project again, I would make sure to, when defining max and min width and heights, make use of % and vw/vh as much as
possible instead of pixels, as these are far more adaptable to different screen sizes and probably would have made my entire job far easier. 

I had a similar issue with some of my earlier pages margins, as alot of them I'd fixed the issues with centering I mentioned above by simply
using pixel margins, which obviously don't always adapt well between one screen size and another. Once I was able to start using the solution
I mentioned above I did this far less often, but again, something I will avoid as much as possible in the future.

I considered going back and fixing these issues but realised that with the amount of times I had done this, it wasn't like sorting out a bug.
To correct my previous choices and make my code less messy I'd be looking at redoing nearly half of my work so far, and just didn't feel this
was the right choice for what is still a highly functional and in my opinion, decently designed website. 

### TESTING ODD SCREENS 

I wont lie, this part was more of a curiosity than anything else, but I decided to use developer tools and see what my website appeared like 
on non-standard devices, choosing to make use of both the surface duo and galaxy fold for this. 

The answer is that in 'Phone mode' for the surface duo the site appears absolutely fine, besides a few random off-center pieces. In 'tablet
mode' however, it essentially breaks completely, as although it's supposed to be like a tablet, its pixel width resolution is 1114px, wider than
my tablet media queries max, meaning the desktop layout is applied to it, which doesn't carry over well at all. I looked at increasing the max 
width of my media query to include this as its currently 1050px, but that would overlap with many desktops running at 1920x1080 and force the 
tablet view on alot of desktop users.

I then looked at the galaxy fold, and achieved essentially the opposite result. In 'tablet mode' it appears nearly perfectly (again with some
off center pieces) but in 'phone mode' parts of the site are almost completely unusable, with much of the sites text and pictures falling over
the left and right sides and the various elements overlapping each other. The reason for this is that its pixel width as a phone is 280px, less
than 2/3rds of the iphone X (which I've used as the primary tester throughout development simply due to its popularity).

The reason for the issues again falls to when I started the project using manual pixel sizes and margins as mentioned before. 

### RESULTS OF TESTING?

From my testing I was able to correct a few small and medium sized issues with the site as well as learn alot of what I did that could have
been improved to structure the site better and make it more adaptable for different screen sizes. The code is messy to start with but gets 
better as I go, and my overall assessment is that the website I've built is fuctional with flaws, and will work well on most standard desktop,
phone and tablet devices and begin to drop off the further we stray from the norm.


## DEPLOYMENT

* The site was created and deployed through the use of gitpod and github, with gitpod being used to create and test the site
and github being used to host the project throughout its creation. I did this as it worked so effectively on the small
projects we made throughout the course that I saw no reason to alter from it, and the two websites integrate together so
well that it just seemed silly to go looking for a solution for a problem that didn't exist. If something works, why fix it?

* Gitpod is efficient and clean for creation and Github needs no explanation for passing to others to look at as it is so 
simple to use. 


## CREDITS

It's very clear to see from looking at my code that a humongous amount of my site is based on two key elements, bootstraps
grid system and its jumbotrons. Although jumbotrons probably aren't intended to be used this way and are supposed to be more
of a big highlight, I found that as my site was so massively based off of rectangles and squares in equal proportions, the
jumbotrons combined with the grid system got what I needed in a far more adaptable way much quicker. The about section on 
the index.html page for example makes use of two jumbotrons that aren't even visible due to my manipulation of them in CSS, 
which might make one question why I used it. The simple answer is though that by using jumbotrons for this task, I was able
to get the site to center in the 2/3rds and 1/3rds way that I wanted far quicker than doing it manually. 

A huge credit for the work goes to the Bootstrap documentation, which I consulted often for making use of their grid system
and jumbotrons.

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/

I also made use of the code institute tutor support a few times throughout the project, but made sure to do this when I had
exhausted all options (slack, stackoverflow, google, etc) and felt it was time inefficient to wait any longer. I never
directly copied any code from anyone, but definitely wouldn't have achieved the result I did as quickly as I did without
building on what the tutors were able to tell me. 

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

I found the inspiration for the site I created by looking at the websites for large successful bands, seeing what they do,
thinking about why they do it and potentially how I could improve upon it. The two main websites that I looked at for my
inspiration were.

https://www.evanescence.com/home/

* Which I took inspiration for the header and footer from, such as the headers use of the band name, social media links and
a navbar icon and the footer being used to provide legal information and the smaller versions of the social icons. I felt
that the site didn't fit all of the requirements though and feel I've improved upon it in certain ways, such as their use
of the navbar appearing from the left. This choice of theirs takes up probably a quarter of the screen and doesn't resize
the rest of the site to accommodate it, and though it doesn't cover the main content because of the way its centered, I
still feel its distracting unnecessarily and just different for the sake of being different. Because of this I feel that
 my choice of a small top navbar below the header is more efficient and just overall neater. 

 The other website I took inspiration from is

 https://www.nickelback.com/

 * They have the top navbar like mine, but it is large and there is no ability to minimise it. Because of this I feel it 
 unnecessarily takes up a large amount of space on the site that could have been used to have the next section peek up
 drawing people further down the site. They also inspired me with the choice to start with a large full size picture of
 the band and have sections of news in rectangles on the home page, but I again felt this was inefficient space-wise and
 that the picture of the band performing really wasn't that high priority, so it would make sense to merge these two 
 elements and have the news overlapping the picture. I also took inspiration from their store, as they also group their
 products into rows of three, but didn't like the way they had created an entire different website for their store 
 (www.nickelbackshop.com) and although I can imagine it's no issue for a large artist, the doubling of hosting and domain
 costs would be a big deal for a small band, so applied a similar idea while all keeping it retained to its own page. 


## FINAL THOUGHTS

From my testing I've learned that although I can make a functional website, I definitely have alot to learn, and based
off of the amount my code has improved from the start of this project to now, I'm confident my projects will only
improve as I continue to work on them. It's obvious to see from my first html document (index.html) to my last one 
(about.html) in this project how much I've improved, and in the future I know I'll be able to apply a huge amount of this 
information in a functional way on many of my projects.

I've replicated my wireframes very well considering I don't consider myself graphically talented, and the only alterations 
I've made are to a couple of the tablet layouts, where I realised in practice that some things simply had to be pushed onto
the next row to make a functional site as it would have to be shrunk too far to be readable (such as the wireframes
 sonnet-news-wireframe.png and sonnet-news-tablet-wireframe.png).
