Sonnet-Of-The-Damned-Band-Site

Milestone project 1: A static webpage for the melodic hardcore band Sonnet Of The Damned. 

The goal of this is to create a usable website for the britisih melodic hardcore band Sonnet of the Damned.
The project is intended to provide a website that is helpful for both fans of the band in acquiring merchandise and
information and providing potential fans of the band the ability to grow their love for them.


UX

The website is for fans of the band and potential fans and is made to serve two seperate purposes. 

The first purpose is to help fans of the band with acquiring information on the band that helps the band grow, such as
finding out when they are performing and where and potentially providing the ability to purchase tickets for these shows,
purchasing merchandise and just finding out news about new releases and information about the band as often fans are
willing to spend more money if they feel a personal connection to the performers, so providing information on the bands 
origins and their individual members helps to do this. 

The second purpose is to help grow the bands audience by giving potential fans of the band the information they need to
learn more about the band and links to the bands music. Although these links aren't necessary for people who are already
fans, they are critical for newcomers so that they can hear the bands music as easily as possible, potentially become
fans and join the first group spoken about above, allowing the band to become more financially successful. This is why the
merchandise and tour pages require use of the navbar where as the newest release, news and about the band section are able
to be accessed directly from the homepage, optimising the site to provide those who are likely to spend the least time 
looking around with the information we want to convey to them first. 

HOMEPAGE UX 

The homepage provides short descriptions of news, new releases and about the band so that it encourages the user to click
further and explore more, as if we gave them everything on the homepage they'd have no reason to go any further. This is
why each section has been put onto its own seperate page, as although the website could be achieved by having a single
long homepage with an individual section instead for each piece, it wouldn't encourage the same exploration or allow
people who already know what they want to get there as easily. It doesn't include tour or merchandise to provide a much
more succinct homepage and as this is something only really necessary for those who are already fans, people who won't be
dissuaded by two extra clicks of the hamburger icon and the page name.

The wireframe for the homepage is linked below (The navbar would be minimised by default and is shown as such on all other
wireframes but has been displayed open on this first wireframe to provide the general idea of its design and how it would
appear on all pages when opened)

NEWS UX

The news page provides a purpose to user for finding out about what the band are up to, as fans of artists often want to
know this kind of information and get as involved as possible in the artist. This allows them to find out what the band 
are up to professionally, such as new releases and information that is provided by the artist for marketing reasons (such 
as performing for a charity, etc.) The news page is designed with three sections inside of it so that its easy to keep 
things relevant and current even if there isn't that much new stuff to talk about. These news boxes will have to be filled
with their information manually, although in an ideal world with enough time I would have them organised with the newest 
piece of news on the left and likely use a javascript library to make them automatically shift to the right by one each 
time a new one is added.

TOUR UX

The tour page is designed with two large boxes each containing the dates and locations of performances, each date having a
single line for it with large margins above and below it. It has been structured this way to make it as easy as possible
to find the tour date and location that is most useful for the user, as the tour page unavoidably needs to hold a lot of
information for a band that plays often and in many locations. I feel the two boxes let the information be seperated in an
efficient way while not requiring the user to scroll down for a long time to find what they are looking for. The faster we
can get a nearby tour date infront of someone's eyes, the better, but if we use too many boxes or too small text the shows
will get lost amongst each other and be useless to anyone other than the most determined user.

MERCH UX

The merch section is designed with rows of boxes, each three long and initially having two rows, each box containing a
picture of the product and the name of the product below it. The reason it's been done this way is to allow for future 
expandability, so that if more products were to be added another row could be created below it very easily without
changing the general shape and design of the page and so that a large amount of products can be seen off of a single
glance. Each box will be clickable to link to the product placed within it, although for a band of the size of Sonnet it
doesn't make sense to create individual pages for each product as they are unlikely to be able to meet the demands of 
processing payment, shipping, etc themselves. For this reason these would likely be external links to print-to-order 
companies that work with dropshipping companies, social media influencers and of course, musicians. The text section is 
very small as very little information needs to be provided at first glance beside the name and possibly price of the 
product being advertised. The picture is the truly important point and thus takes up the majority of the space. All other
necessary information such as sizing for clothing, descriptions, fabric types, etc. can be provided on the other side of
the external link.

ABOUT UX

The about page is created with two sections. The first provides information about the origins of the band, what they do,
what they aspire to be, who they take inspiration from, etc. This is inside a large box that takes up about 80% of the
screen, and is further split into thirds within that 80%, with the first two thirds being columns of text providing the
information mentioned before and the last third being another picture of the band. It's created this way to keep the 
design interesting and not overload the user with too much text, as if things are boring the user will leave quicker than
we want them to.

The second section takes that same 80% of the screen, but instead does it with 4 equal boxes in a single row. This creates
more boxes in one row than any other page on the website, but is a purposeful decision. Each box provides a picture of and
information on an individual band member, and these smaller boxes make sense as we probably want to provide much less 
detailed info when talking about each musician seperate from the band as a whole. This second section is designed really
for either those looking for information about the band members (questions like 'What's the bassist from Sonnet's name 
again?" are solved by this) or for those that were really, genuinely intrigued by the information in the first section and
want to know more.

HEADER UX

The header was designed with a simple goal and thus is kept very basic. The links to the current active socials are
provided on the left, the name of the band is centered and the burger icon to access the navbar is to the right. It was
done this way so that the social media's are extremely easy to find, the name of the band is obvious and apparent and the
navbar is minimised by default but easy to get to when needed. It also makes it very easy to adapt in the future, such as
if the band joined a new social media platform they would only need to add one more icon to the left to update the site
without changing the overall appearance. 

NAVBAR UX

The navbar was designed as simply as possible with just the names of the pages they are linking provided ina large highly
readable font, and all of these being centered towards the middle with good margins to the left and right to make them as
obvious as possible. This simple design, much like the header, is made to be future proof, as adding a new page to the
site would be as simple as dropping another link in and assigning it the same classes as provided to the rest.

FOOTER UX

The footer was designed with a similar but slightly different thought process from the navbar and header. To provide info
that needs to be provided without drawing attention in the same way the rest of the site is supposed to. Stuff like copy-
rights and legal information that you want findable but aren't fighting to get seen. I've also included smaller buttons
that link to the same social medias as the buttons found in the header to the right, so that if a standard user who 
couldn't care less about the legals does find their eyes down around the footer, they can still gain valuable information
from it. 

GENERAL AND MOBILE UX

The last bit of UX I wish to talk about is the general shape of the site. It's very obvious from the way I've designed it
that I like making use of squares, rectangles and generally splitting things and information into their own individual 
pieces. The reason its been done this way is dual faceted. The first is that it allows to cleanly seperate information away
from things that don't relate to it and lets a user focus in completely on the bit they care about without having to work to
filter out what they don't. The second is that the site was also designed with mobile devices in mind, and this design of 
pieces, all split into halfs, thirds and quarters allows the site to adapt to mobile with a much smaller amount of media
queries needing to be used to adapt things. The columns of text in the about section for example, would change from thirds
to a string of text and a picture below it, and the rectangles for each band member will simply fall below each other one
by one.


IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

NAVBAR ICON 

I included a navbar icon to allow it to be expanded and minimised as a feature for a few reasons. It wasn't really necessary
but it does save space on the initial view of the homepage and thus allows more of the important information thats really 
trying to drag people in to be viewed without delay. 

SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS

In the header and footer I included icons that link to the various relevant social medias simply because to alot of artists
their social medias are far more important to them than their individual websites, and are thus updated more often than a 
website will be. The same applies to the use by a user, as the average person is likely to check their facebook far more 
than they are to visit the website of a specific band, so having these links provided in an easy to notice, immediately
apparent form is more helpful for the user and the band. 


CONSIDERED FEATURES

CONTACT FORM 

I looked at implenting a contact form, and this would have been fairly easy to do, but decided not to go for it as although
it sounds like something that would be valuable, it wouldn't have actually had a large practical use to the band. When the
purpose of the website is to help sell to your fans and bring in new fans to sell to, a contact form doesn't aid either of
these goals, and although it might have been helpful for the band to allow promoters and venues to contact them for booking,
it was unlikely to be used much anyway as most promoters contact small bands directly through their social medias or by 
emailing them (I take this information from the last 5 years I've spent running my own small independent promotion company).
Because of this, I felt it was better to just include the bands contact email in the footer and allow the social buttons to
do the job otherwise. This achieves the same goal but is quicker and more space efficient.

PAYMENT SYSTEM

I looked at implementing a payment system through the use of a javascript library so that merchandise and show tickets could
be sold directly on the website, and although this would have been good to include and potentially increase turnover for the
band, I decided that at my current skill level it would take too long to do to create something I was happy with. Not to
mention, its still very easy to include the ability to sell merch and tickets, by simply swapping a built in payment system 
out for external companies. Merchandise can be delivered through print-to-order companies like printful.com and the tickets
for the shows can be done through websites like ticketsource.co.uk. These external companies might take commissions from the
band that a built in payment system wouldn't, but are far more realistic and manageable for a small band. 


LIBRARIES 

BOOTSTRAP

The project makes use of bootstrap throughout the site quite simply because it makes alot of things a whole lot easier. from
shaping the site into the halfs, thirds and quarters I spoke about before to adaptation for mobile devices and different
screen sizes, bootstraps pre-included classes helped massively with the construction of the site.


TESTING

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


DEPLOYMENT

The site was created and deployed through the use of gitpod and github, with gitpod being used to create and test the site
and github being used to host the project throughout its creation. I did this as it worked so effectively on the small
projects we made throughout the course that I saw no reason to alter from it, and the two websites integrate together so
well that it just seemed silly to go looking for a solution for a problem that didn't exist. If something works, why fix it?

Gitpod is efficient and clean for creation and Github needs no explanation for passing to others to look at as it is so 
simple to use.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

I found the inspiration for the site I created by looking at the websites for large successful bands, seeing what they do,
thinking about why they do it and potentially how I could improve upon it. The two main websites that I looked at for my
inspiration were.

https://www.evanescence.com/home/

Which I took inspiration for the header and footer from, such as the headers use of the band name, social media links and
a navbar icon and the footer being used to provide legal information and the smaller versions of the social icons. I felt
that the site didn't fit all of the requirements though and feel I've improved upon it in certain ways, such as their use
of the navbar appearing from the left. This choice of theirs takes up probably a quarter of the screen and doesn't resize
the rest of the site to accommodate it, and though it doesn't cover the main content because of the way its centered, I
still feel its distracting unnecessarily and just different for the sake of being different. Because of this I feel that
 my choice of a small top navbar below the header is more efficient and just overall neater. 

 The other website I took inspiration from is

 https://www.nickelback.com/

 They have the top navbar like mine, but it is large and there is no ability to minimise it. Because of this I feel it 
 unnecessarily takes up a large amount of space on the site that could have been used to have the next section peek up
 drawing people further down the site. They also inspired me with the choice to start with a large full size picture of
 the band and have sections of news in rectangles on the home page, but I again felt this was inefficient space-wise and
 that the picture of the band performing really wasn't that high priority, so it would make sense to merge these two 
 elements and have the news overlapping the picture. I also took inspiration from their store, as they also group their
 products into rows of three, but didn't like the way they had created an entire different website for their store 
 (www.nickelbackshop.com) and although I can imagine it's no issue for a large artist, the doubling of hosting and domain
 costs would be a big deal for a small band, so applied a similar idea while all keeping it retained to its own page.
