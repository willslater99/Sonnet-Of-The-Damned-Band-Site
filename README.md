Sonnet-Of-The-Damned-Band-Site

Milestone project 1: A static webpage for the melodic hardcore band Sonnet Of The Damned. 

The goal of this is to create a usable website for the britisih melodic hardcore band Sonnet of the Damned.
The project is intended to provide a website that is helpful for both fans of the band in acquiring merchandise and
information and providing potential fans of the band the ability to grow their love for them.


UX

The website is for fans of the band and potential fans and is made to serve two seperate purposes. 

The first purpose is to help fans of the band with acquiring information on the band that helps the band grow, such as
finding out when they are performing and where and potentially providing the ability to purchase tickets for these shows,
purchasing merchandise and just finding out news about new releases and information about the band as often fans are
willing to spend more money if they feel a personal connection to the performers, so providing information on the bands 
origins and their individual members helps to do this. 

The second purpose is to help grow the bands audience by giving potential fans of the band the information they need to
learn more about the band and links to the bands music. Although these links aren't necessary for people who are already
fans, they are critical for newcomers so that they can hear the bands music as easily as possible, potentially become
fans and join the first group spoken about above, allowing the band to become more financially successful. This is why the
merchandise and tour pages require use of the navbar where as the newest release, news and about the band section are able
to be accessed directly from the homepage, optimising the site to provide those who are likely to spend the least time 
looking around with the information we want to convey to them first. 

The homepage provides short descriptions of news, new releases and about the band so that it encourages the user to click
further and explore more, as if we gave them everything on the homepage they'd have no reason to go any further. This is
why each section has been put onto its own seperate page, as although the website could be achieved by having a single
long homepage with an individual section instead for each piece, it wouldn't encourage the same exploration or allow
people who already know what they want to get there as easily. It doesn't include tour or merchandise to provide a much
more succinct homepage and as this is something only really necessary for those who are already fans, people who won't be
dissuaded by two extra clicks of the hamburger icon and the page name.

The wireframe for the homepage is linked below (The navbar would be minimised by default and is shown as such on all other
wireframes but has been displayed open on this first wireframe to provide the general idea of its design and how it would
appear on all pages when opened)


As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
